The first half of the year is drawing to a close, and I'm finally finding the time to write a blog post.

These 6 months have been particularly intense, mainly on 2 big freelance projects, Pomme d'appli and Tous FAMiliés (where I'm also co-founder). I managed to free up some time for Tombol'App (one of my side projects) and for a few contributions to a long-term freelance project, In-SCI.

# Pomme d’appli

[Pomme d'appli](https://www.pommedappli.com) is a website that puts early childhood professionals in touch with parents and future parents.

The project was officially launched on May 1. This project is a real case study that will make me change a lot of things about my framing and that has taught me a lot. The quotation was signed in December 2021, the UX/UI Process took almost 8 months to complete in 2022, and as I wasn't in charge of this part, I made the mistake of following too far behind. As a result, the functional scope changed dramatically, and development took me almost twice as long as originally planned.

But I'm particularly proud of the final result.

This project also enabled me to experiment with the use of Inertia.js (with Laravel) for the entire front-end, a really powerful technology, but with a few minor caveats. Hopefully I'll find time to do a REX article on it.

# Tous FAMiliés

[Tous FAMiliés](https://tousfamilies.fr) is a start-up studio project just the way I like them. We're 3 perfectly complementary partners, and the project has huge national and international growth potential.

The project consists of a cross-platform (iOS and Android) mobile application (smartphone only for the moment) of a private family social network type. Selected recipients from subscribed families receive a printed diary of their publications over the past month, enhanced with additional content (games, recipes...).

My French readers will immediately see what this is all about, as a "competitor" has been advertising heavily on TV since last Christmas.

This project was launched in December last year and has been officially available on mobile stores since June 1.

I've been able to make further progress on Flutter (this is my 4th project on this technology) and again on Laravel (I've lost count of the number of projects I've done on this technology :) ).

# Final thoughts

In short, the first half of the year has been very busy with freelance projects. I've still made a lot of technical progress, that's the magic of development.

The second half for 2023 is still unclear on the freelance front, but I'll be able to take some time out in the coming weeks to fine-tune my online presence. I'll start by migrating and revamping my pro website [Koojira Studio](https://koojira.com). Then I'll tackle my communication "strategy".

Today my communication is almost non-existent and I need to fix that. I'm in the zone of those who don't post because "it's probably already been said", but surely in 20 years of experience I must have some interesting information to share. So I really need to change that.

And it starts now!
