Where to start ... First of all, welcome to this blog, which will serve both as a diary of my entrepreneurial adventures and as a place to share my discoveries, opinions, tests and maybe even advice (in all humility, of course), on the subjects that interest me. These subjects will most probably be tech-oriented, because that's what I'm passionate about, entrepreneurship, but they could also concern the world of video games, literature, as well as anything to do with productivity (but not in guru mode, I'm more into simplifying / lightening).

So that you can get an idea of whether or not this blog is of interest to you, I thought a quick introduction might help.
My name is Thomas Ledesert and, at the time of writing, I'm a freelance web and mobile developer, as well as the solo entrepreneur of a startup called Tombol'App, which publishes the mobile game of the same name (a tombola and scratch-off ticket game based on advertising and allowing players to win real money). For more details, please visit the "About us" page.

I think this must be the 5th or 6th time I've written the first post of a blog but I've never managed to publish them and get going. It's probably the impostor syndrome that tends to block this kind of initiative for me. Yet I read a lot of blogs, which for me are much more enjoyable and informative than social networks. It was only a few days ago, when I came across Ploum's blog (Ploum.net), that I realized that I had to get over my hang-ups and that there's no right time to get started, or even that the important thing is not so much the form as the content. And that the content doesn't have to be thought out or calculated, and that it's precisely the sincerity of what's said that will, or won't, lead readers to take an interest. So thank you Ploum (and even double thank you, because your writings have enabled me to put into words some of my thoughts/feelings about RS, disconnection, low tech ...).

As is often the case when the urge to write takes hold of me, I looked to see what the authors I read use in terms of hardware, software and process; once again falling into the trap of looking for the perfect setup, even if it has to be minimalist. And it was several more of Ploum's articles that helped me stop this habitual procrastination. Because beyond hardware and software, the solution for me lies in simplification. I already have all the tools I need, but as is often the case, I tend to load them up with all the potentially useful applications one day, preventing me from finding the necessary focus. So the key for me was to simplify my tools.

So I've started streamlining my tools so as to have one main support dedicated to writing, and I'll probably do a post on this once I've got my bearings. Now I've just got to get my writing routine right, because I really want to make progress and enjoy writing, and who knows, get feedback on my work.

I hope you'll find my writing interesting and useful. If you've read this far, thank you very much and see you soon.
